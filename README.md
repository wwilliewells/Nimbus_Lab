# Nimbus_Lab
This directory includes projects I worked on as a Masters student as part of the NIMBUS (Nebraska Intelligent MoBile Unpersonned Systems) Laboratory.

I wrote several shell scripts to automate operations I performed frequently.

Sphere is my Demo (entrance into NIMBUS Lab) project.

Flight testing was my first full project. This project focused on identifying common unpersonned aerial vehicle failures and their causes. This is the primary focus of my Masters Project Defense.

GPS testing includes my radio frequency testing work as well. These two projects were worked on together and separately. The GPS testing involved attempting to integrate an affordable RTK GPS system into the main research vehicle in the laboratory. The radio frequency testing involed testing the usable range of XBee Pros.
